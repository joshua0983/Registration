# Registration



Developed and deployed a streamlined class registration system that efficiently processes a list of students' class preferences, taking into account their order of preference and the availability of classes. Additionally, implemented advanced algorithms to further enhance the registration process by factoring in students' draw numbers, ensuring a fair and efficient allocation of classes. This combination of systematic registration and algorithmic optimization has significantly improved the overall registration experience, providing students with a smoother and more equitable class assignment process.
